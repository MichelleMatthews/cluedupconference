## What we’ll learn about

> The ability to learn faster than your competitors may be the only sustainable competitive advantage.

How do we:

- Make workers and citizens future-fit?
- Create job-ready young people out of a broken education system?
- Develop talent pipelines that will increase our competitiveness?
- Incentivise a learning culture in our organisations?
- Retain employees with growth mindsets? 
- Reskill aging workforces? 
- Engage and educate customers?
- Stay relevant ourselves?

All CluedUp presenters are doers. They present “action studies”, so that delegates get practical insights about cutting-edge projects tackling:

- Productive gamification 
- Scaffolding for leadership development
- Proxies for potential
- Teaming humans with AI
- Teaching coding to youth who have failed maths

… and other exciting experiments
